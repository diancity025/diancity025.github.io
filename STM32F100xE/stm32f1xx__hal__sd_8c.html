  ==============================================================================
                        ##### How to use this driver #####
  ==============================================================================
  [..]
    This driver implements a high level communication layer for read and write from/to
    this memory. The needed STM32 hardware resources (SDIO and GPIO) are performed by
    the user in HAL_SD_MspInit() function (MSP layer).
    Basically, the MSP layer configuration should be the same as we provide in the
    examples.
    You can easily tailor this configuration according to hardware resources.

  [..]
    This driver is a generic layered driver for SDIO memories which uses the HAL
    SDIO driver functions to interface with SD and uSD cards devices.
    It is used as follows:

    (#)Initialize the SDIO low level resources by implementing the HAL_SD_MspInit() API:
        (##) Enable the SDIO interface clock using __HAL_RCC_SDIO_CLK_ENABLE();
        (##) SDIO pins configuration for SD card
            (+++) Enable the clock for the SDIO GPIOs using the functions __HAL_RCC_GPIOx_CLK_ENABLE();
            (+++) Configure these SDIO pins as alternate function pull-up using HAL_GPIO_Init()
                  and according to your pin assignment;
        (##) DMA configuration if you need to use DMA process (HAL_SD_ReadBlocks_DMA()
             and HAL_SD_WriteBlocks_DMA() APIs).
            (+++) Enable the DMAx interface clock using __HAL_RCC_DMAx_CLK_ENABLE();
            (+++) Configure the DMA using the function HAL_DMA_Init() with predeclared and filled.
        (##) NVIC configuration if you need to use interrupt process when using DMA transfer.
            (+++) Configure the SDIO and DMA interrupt priorities using functions
                  HAL_NVIC_SetPriority(); DMA priority is superior to SDIO's priority
            (+++) Enable the NVIC DMA and SDIO IRQs using function HAL_NVIC_EnableIRQ()
            (+++) SDIO interrupts are managed using the macros __HAL_SD_ENABLE_IT()
                  and __HAL_SD_DISABLE_IT() inside the communication process.
            (+++) SDIO interrupts pending bits are managed using the macros __HAL_SD_GET_IT()
                  and __HAL_SD_CLEAR_IT()
        (##) NVIC configuration if you need to use interrupt process (HAL_SD_ReadBlocks_IT()
             and HAL_SD_WriteBlocks_IT() APIs).
            (+++) Configure the SDIO interrupt priorities using function HAL_NVIC_SetPriority();
            (+++) Enable the NVIC SDIO IRQs using function HAL_NVIC_EnableIRQ()
            (+++) SDIO interrupts are managed using the macros __HAL_SD_ENABLE_IT()
                  and __HAL_SD_DISABLE_IT() inside the communication process.
            (+++) SDIO interrupts pending bits are managed using the macros __HAL_SD_GET_IT()
                  and __HAL_SD_CLEAR_IT()
    (#) At this stage, you can perform SD read/write/erase operations after SD card initialization


  *** SD Card Initialization and configuration ***
  ================================================
  [..]
    To initialize the SD Card, use the HAL_SD_Init() function. It Initializes
    SDIO Peripheral(STM32 side) and the SD Card, and put it into StandBy State (Ready for data transfer).
    This function provide the following operations:

    (#) Apply the SD Card initialization process at 400KHz and check the SD Card
        type (Standard Capacity or High Capacity). You can change or adapt this
        frequency by adjusting the "ClockDiv" field.
        The SD Card frequency (SDIO_CK) is computed as follows:

           SDIO_CK = SDIOCLK / (ClockDiv + 2)

        In initialization mode and according to the SD Card standard,
        make sure that the SDIO_CK frequency doesn't exceed 400KHz.

        This phase of initialization is done through SDIO_Init() and
        SDIO_PowerState_ON() SDIO low level APIs.

    (#) Initialize the SD card. The API used is HAL_SD_InitCard().
        This phase allows the card initialization and identification
        and check the SD Card type (Standard Capacity or High Capacity)
        The initialization flow is compatible with SD standard.

        This API (HAL_SD_InitCard()) could be used also to reinitialize the card in case
        of plug-off plug-in.

    (#) Configure the SD Card Data transfer frequency. You can change or adapt this
        frequency by adjusting the "ClockDiv" field.
        In transfer mode and according to the SD Card standard, make sure that the
        SDIO_CK frequency doesn't exceed 25MHz and 50MHz in High-speed mode switch.
        To be able to use a frequency higher than 24MHz, you should use the SDIO
        peripheral in bypass mode. Refer to the corresponding reference manual
        for more details.

    (#) Select the corresponding SD Card according to the address read with the step 2.

    (#) Configure the SD Card in wide bus mode: 4-bits data.

  *** SD Card Read operation ***
  ==============================
  [..]
    (+) You can read from SD card in polling mode by using function HAL_SD_ReadBlocks().
        This function support only 512-bytes block length (the block size should be
        chosen as 512 bytes).
        You can choose either one block read operation or multiple block read operation
        by adjusting the "NumberOfBlocks" parameter.
        After this, you have to ensure that the transfer is done correctly. The check is done
        through HAL_SD_GetCardState() function for SD card state.

    (+) You can read from SD card in DMA mode by using function HAL_SD_ReadBlocks_DMA().
        This function support only 512-bytes block length (the block size should be
        chosen as 512 bytes).
        You can choose either one block read operation or multiple block read operation
        by adjusting the "NumberOfBlocks" parameter.
        After this, you have to ensure that the transfer is done correctly. The check is done
        through HAL_SD_GetCardState() function for SD card state.
        You could also check the DMA transfer process through the SD Rx interrupt event.

    (+) You can read from SD card in Interrupt mode by using function HAL_SD_ReadBlocks_IT().
        This function support only 512-bytes block length (the block size should be
        chosen as 512 bytes).
        You can choose either one block read operation or multiple block read operation
        by adjusting the "NumberOfBlocks" parameter.
        After this, you have to ensure that the transfer is done correctly. The check is done
        through HAL_SD_GetCardState() function for SD card state.
        You could also check the IT transfer process through the SD Rx interrupt event.

  *** SD Card Write operation ***

        chosen as 512 bytes).
        You can choose either one block read operation or multiple block read operation
        by adjusting the "NumberOfBlocks" parameter.
        After this, you have to ensure that the transfer is done correctly. The check is done
        through HAL_SD_GetCardState() function for SD card state.

    (+) You can write to SD card in DMA mode by using function HAL_SD_WriteBlocks_DMA().

        chosen as 512 bytes).
        You can choose either one block read operation or multiple block read operation
        by adjusting the "NumberOfBlocks" parameter.
        After this, you have to ensure that the transfer is done correctly. The check is done
        through HAL_SD_GetCardState() function for SD card state.
        You could also check the DMA transfer process through the SD Tx interrupt event.

    (+) You can write to SD card in Interrupt mode by using function HAL_SD_WriteBlocks_IT().
        This function support only 512-bytes block length (the block size should be
        chosen as 512 bytes).
        You can choose either one block read operation or multiple block read operation
        by adjusting the "NumberOfBlocks" parameter.
        After this, you have to ensure that the transfer is done correctly. The check is done
        through HAL_SD_GetCardState() function for SD card state.
        You could also check the IT transfer process through the SD Tx interrupt event.

  *** SD card status ***
  ======================
  [..]
    (+) The SD Status contains status bits that are related to the SD Memory
        Card proprietary features. To get SD card status use the HAL_SD_GetCardStatus().

  *** SD card information ***
  ===========================
  [..]
    (+) To get SD card information, you can use the function HAL_SD_GetCardInfo().
        It returns useful information about the SD card such as block size, card type,
        block number ...

  *** SD card CSD register ***
  ============================
    (+) The HAL_SD_GetCardCSD() API allows to get the parameters of the CSD register.
        Some of the CSD parameters are useful for card initialization and identification.

    (+) __HAL_SD_CLEAR_FLAG: Clear the SD's pending flags

    (@) You can refer to the SD HAL driver header file for more useful macros

  *** Callback registration ***
  =============================================
  [..]
    The compilation define USE_HAL_SD_REGISTER_CALLBACKS when set to 1
    allows the user to configure dynamically the driver callbacks.

    Use Functions @ref HAL_SD_RegisterCallback() to register a user callback,
    it allows to register following callbacks:
      (+) TxCpltCallback : callback when a transmission transfer is completed.
      (+) RxCpltCallback : callback when a reception transfer is completed.
      (+) ErrorCallback : callback when error occurs.
      (+) AbortCpltCallback : callback when abort is completed.
      (+) MspInitCallback    : SD MspInit.
      (+) MspDeInitCallback  : SD MspDeInit.
    This function takes as parameters the HAL peripheral handle, the Callback ID
    and a pointer to the user callback function.

    Use function @ref HAL_SD_UnRegisterCallback() to reset a callback to the default
    weak (surcharged) function. It allows to reset following callbacks:
      (+) TxCpltCallback : callback when a transmission transfer is completed.
      (+) RxCpltCallback : callback when a reception transfer is completed.
      (+) ErrorCallback : callback when error occurs.
      (+) AbortCpltCallback : callback when abort is completed.
      (+) MspInitCallback    : SD MspInit.
      (+) MspDeInitCallback  : SD MspDeInit.
    This function) takes as parameters the HAL peripheral handle and the Callback ID.

    By default, after the @ref HAL_SD_Init and if the state is HAL_SD_STATE_RESET
    all callbacks are reset to the corresponding legacy weak (surcharged) functions.
    Exception done for MspInit and MspDeInit callbacks that are respectively
    reset to the legacy weak (surcharged) functions in the @ref HAL_SD_Init
    and @ref  HAL_SD_DeInit only when these callbacks are null (not registered beforehand).
    If not, MspInit or MspDeInit are not null, the @ref HAL_SD_Init and @ref HAL_SD_DeInit
    keep and use the user MspInit/MspDeInit callbacks (registered beforehand)

    Callbacks can be registered/unregistered in READY state only.
    Exception done for MspInit/MspDeInit callbacks that can be registered/unregistered
    in READY or RESET state, thus registered (user) MspInit/DeInit callbacks can be used
    during the Init/DeInit.
    In that case first register the MspInit/MspDeInit user callbacks
    using @ref HAL_SD_RegisterCallback before calling @ref HAL_SD_DeInit
    or @ref HAL_SD_Init function.

    When The compilation define USE_HAL_SD_REGISTER_CALLBACKS is set to 0 or
    not defined, the callback registering feature is not available
    and weak (surcharged) callbacks are used.
